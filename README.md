# ragtag-player-remote

A stripped back version of the player on [Ragtag Archive](https://archive.ragtag.moe) forked from [here](https://github.com/0t4u/ragtag-player-butchered) with a few minor tweaks and changes.

- Added support to render basic .info.json information (title, description, channel name)
- Able to use query parameters to directly load into the player if files are hosted on some remote source
